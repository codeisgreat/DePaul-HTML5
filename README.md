DePaul HTML5
============

DePaul's Web Development with AJAX technologies course covers a wide swath of web technologies from basic HTML and CSS, to JavaScript with jQuery to the latest HTML5 and CSS3 innovations.  This repository contains my lecture materials for this course (I cover the HTML5 and CSS3 sessions).  Delivered in three parts, my section covers the new markup features in HTML5 the first session, CSS3 and responsive design the second session and finishes with a third session of new APIs including things like Web Sockets.
